#  Job Shop Scheduling with Genetic Algorithm

This project solves the **Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP)** using a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** and visualizes the optimal schedule using a **Gantt chart**. It was developed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence **.

##  Problem Description

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) consists of a set of jobs, each made up of ordered operations. Each operation must run on a specific machine for a given duration. The main objective is to **minimize the makespan**, i.e., the total time required to complete all jobs.

We applied a genetic algorithm that:
- Encodes each job as a sequence of operation indices.
- Evaluates fitness based on makespan.
- Uses crossover and mutation to explore the search space.
- Produces an optimal schedule visualized with a Gantt chart.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### âœ¨ Features
- Chromosome-based encoding of job sequences.
- Fitness function based on makespan.
- Parent selection via tournament.
- Single-point crossover.
- Mutation by swapping operations.
- Gantt chart output using `matplotlib`.
